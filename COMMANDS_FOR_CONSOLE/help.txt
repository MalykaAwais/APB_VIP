for commands:

// There is a file.f already present in the (main) tb folder.
// Just go in that directory and 

Open linux console (in our case REDHAT LINUX ENTERPRISE OS)

csh
source ~./cshrc
xrun -f file.f 

// FOR COVERAGE

xrun -f file.f -coverage all

// FOR GUI AND ENABLING LIVE DATA I HAVE ALREADY ADDED COMMANDS IN file.f in commented form

Incase of any error due to directory structure, just keep the CODE folder in the outermost directory e.g DOCUMENTS of your directory structure
This is how it is adjusted in file.f
