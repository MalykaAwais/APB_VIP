APB_SLAVE directory has all code for slave uvc

Rest of the code including master and scoreboard etc are present in sv

And top level files in tb folder

Incase of any error due to directory structure, just keep the CODE folder in the outermost directory e.g DOCUMENTS of your directory structure
This is how it is adjusted in file.f
